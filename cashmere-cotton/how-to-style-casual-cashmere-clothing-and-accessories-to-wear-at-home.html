	<h1>How to Style Casual Cashmere Clothing and Accessories to Wear at Home</h1>
	<p>Cashmere is one of those materials which simply oozes style and luxury. Incredibly soft and indulgent, cashmere goods are always in demand meaning that there is plenty of choice on the market for those looking to treat themselves to a new wardrobe, whatever their style. Cashmere loungewear is one of the fastest growing types of cashmere clothing, especially as recent global events have meant we are staying at home much more than usual.</p>
	<p>Cashmere loungewear and pyjamas are perhaps the ultimate way to relax in style at home, and there are many reasons why you might want to dress up your casual loungewear to elevate your look. Dressing up for dinner dates at home or Zoom calls with friends and family is a great way to give yourself a pick me up, and gives you the chance to explore different looks with your cashmere wardrobe staples.</p>
	<p>One of the cosiest and most popular cashmere items are cashmere bed socks which are plush and toasty, perfect for winter wear around the home. You can style these with your favourite lounge pants or joggers for a truly relaxed look, or pair them with skinny jeans or leggings for a more fitted look. Thick cashmere socks which are designed to be worn without shoes in the home also look great pulled up the leg above short lambskin or suede boots such as Ugg boots or your regular fleece lined ankle length slippers.</p>
	<p>Socks are one of the easiest cashmere clothing options to style and they are a joy to wear, especially on chilly winter and spring evenings when your toes will appreciate the extra warmth. Look for options in neutral colours or soft pastels for cashmere socks that will go with anything, or make a bold statement with stronger colours.</p>
	<p>There are few loungewear styles more indulgent and luxurious than cashmere dressing gowns. The ultimate in comfortable loungewear, dressing gowns in soft cashmere can be styled as an extra cosy outerwear layer in the home, so simply throw one on over your regular daily clothing, but leave it open at the waist so it gives the impression of a long, oversized cardigan.</p>
	<p>Dressing gowns are the perfect coverup for chilly days, and are extremely comforting, which is what we are all about in the autumn, winter, and spring. Traditional styles tend to either have a tie waist or button closure, though button closure is quite old fashioned and uncommon in comparison. If you would like to style your dressing gown as an informal outer layer to wear in the house, choose neutral colours such as tan, grey, and black as these will go best with a good range of outfits.</p>
	<p>One of the most versatile cashmere accessories you can incorporate into your regular rotation are scarves, particularly the wide kind that can double as a shawl or wrap. These are great for snuggling into when you are either working from home or are taking some time to relax. They are great for keeping your arms, shoulders and neck nice and warm, and the larger styles can even be worn as blankets. A&nbsp;<a href="https://cashmereandcotton.co.uk/collections/cashmere-ponchos"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>cashmere poncho</strong></em></span></a>&nbsp;is also a great choice if you are looking for something cosy and warm for your upper body.</p>
	<p>Cashmere clothing and accessories can easily be styled to suit your personal taste, whether that is casual or more refined. The versatility of cashmere clothing allows you to create cosy looks which are all about comfort as well as casually elegant looks which are perfect for everyday. Your outfits can also be dressed up with your choice in jewellery and hair accessories as well as your choice of footwear, so you can easily turn a casual outfit into something elegant and elevated. Loungewear is a modern clothing phenomenon, and it seems it is here to stay - find your perfect match and upgrade your free time with cashmere loungewear.</p>
