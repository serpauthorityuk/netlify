	<h1>Our Guide to Choosing and Presenting Gifts</h1>
	<p>If you are anything like me, you spend about as much time thinking about how to package and present your gifts as you do choosing the gift itself. There is just something extra special about receiving a beautifully packaged present and the anticipation you feel just before you start to break into the packaging. While the finished results of your efforts can be very satisfying, it can also be a source of unnecessary stress as you try to get it right.</p>
	<p>While some people certainly enjoy the ritual of wrapping presents, it's not everyone's favourite activity and it can even feel like a chore especially when you're taking on a mountain of gifts at once. Wrapping paper can look absolutely spectacular when it's done properly, but there are many options available to you to simplify the entire process.</p>
	<h2>Gift presentation made easy</h2>
	<p>In the run up to Christmas many of us will be extremely busy as we prepare for the big day. Wrapping gifts can be a hugely time-consuming task, but there are plenty of options that can give almost instant results such as the use of gift boxes and bags. <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/home-decor-accessories"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Unique home decor</strong></em></span></a> and other items which on a uniform size and shape can easily be stashed inside a bag or box and finished with an attractive bow.</p>
	<p>One of the best things about using gift bags and boxes over wrapping paper is that they can be used more than once and still look fresh. If you have children, one thing you might notice on Christmas Day is that you're soon left with quite a pile of discarded wrapping paper. Gift bags and boxes make the tidying up process much faster and there is less mess to deal with which gives you time for the most enjoyable parts of Christmas such as the all-important Christmas dinner.</p>
	<h2>Gift packaging for all occasions</h2>
	<p>Whilst the festive season might be the one most strongly associated with the giving and receiving of gifts, there are plenty of other occasions that take place throughout every year that call for the exchanging of gifts. For example you might be looking for the perfect <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/home-decor-accessories"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>unique housewarming gifts</strong></em></span></a> for a friend or loved one, and traditionally these kinds of gifts will be something for the home and can be practical or decorative.</p>
	<p>Birthdays, Christenings and anniversaries are all events that call for gifting, and you can easily find options that are perfect and sure to bring a smile to the face of whoever is receiving the gift before they even know what is inside. Age and occasion appropriate packaging can be found online and on the high street, and there is so much choice on offer that you are sure to find something that is personal to the recipient, perhaps in their favourite colours in a style that suits their personality.</p> <span style="display: block; text-align: center; clear: both;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_GkDAKinu8?modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
	<h2>Gift ideas for birthdays, Christmas, anniversaries and more</h2>
	<p>It can be hard to pick the perfect gift for someone, even if you know them very well. You are likely to feel at least a tiny bit of doubt at some point as you choose your gifts, but there is always that someone who is just completely impossible to buy for. If you find yourself completely at a loss, we will hopefully provide you with some ideas that can give you a helping hand in getting started.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Perfume and aftershave are a classic choice that even the trickiest birthday boy or girl is sure to appreciate. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to do a little snooping and see if you can find out what their favourite fragrance is.</li>
		<li>Something for the home can be a good choice, and can be anything from <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/home-decor-accessories"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>unique home accessories</strong></em></span></a> to something practical like a beautiful set of crystal glasses.</li>
		<li>Gift vouchers are always a good bet for those who have everything. From their favourite coffee house, to online vouchers for their favourite website, they will be able to choose their own gift and take the pressure of the choice from you.</li>
		<li>Consumable or short-lived gifts such as flowers and chocolates are ideal in a pinch as they are generally well-received and feel personal without it being a high stakes option.</li>
