	<h1>Eco-Friendly Bird Watching in 2021</h1>
	<p>Most of us will think we are just doing the right thing by feeding the birds in our garden, whether this is just to keep them fed or whether it is to attract them into our garden so that we can watch them. What we probably aren&rsquo;t aware of however, is how eco-friendly we are being, or not being. So below we take a look at how environmentally friendly our bird watching habits are.</p>
	<p>The bigger bird watching is becoming, the more products we are using and the more manufacturers are therefore producing. It has become a lot more popular to use non-recyclable plastics in our gardens and us, as consumers, usually don&rsquo;t question this as they are a cheaper alternative to metal or any other material. We can see non-recyclable plastics for lots of products that we use to help us bird watch, such as bird feeders, bird baths, bird boxes and nest boxes. Before we even think about how much damage the plastic does after their use, it turns out it is damaging for the environment before it&rsquo;s even been made. Nearly all forms of plastic are made using fossil fuels, so the more plastic we make, the more fossil fuels we need. This pushes an increase in the amount that we are harvesting and using to power the machine to manufacture the material.</p>
	<p>Once the plastic is then made for example, into a <a href="http://photohistory.oregonstate.edu/works/studies/the-best-wild-bird-feeding-methods-for-small-bird-species">bird feeder,</a> we use it a few times and it may become scratched and dirty, lots of us would then decide to throw it in the bin and buy a new one, as it is a cheaper alternative to using a reusable one. Plastic will then overflow at landfill sites and spread into the sea, destroying lots of habitats and contaminating the water. Plastic can take hundreds of years to decompose and all of the chemicals will break down overtime polluting the sea.</p>
	<p>So let's compare this to the use of natural long-lasting materials like stone and recyclable materials such as metals, wood and recyclable plastics. Natural stone is one of the most sustainable materials that you can use in your garden. Natural stone can also limit miles in delivery as you can use natural stone from the UK. Another benefit would be that the material is natural and not man-made, so again this is reducing any carbon emissions being used in production too. Lastly, this material is extremely durable and will last a very long time, so you shouldn&rsquo;t ever need to throw it away. If you didn&rsquo;t want to use it again, then you can repurpose it into something else for your garden too. A stone birdbath is likely to be more expensive than any other material but you have to weigh up lifespan. A material such as this will last a lot longer than any other material, meaning you don't need to replace it in a few years, so it will work out cheaper and better for the environment.</p>
	<p>A negative of having a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/birdcare-wildlife-bird-baths/">stone bird bath</a></strong></em></span> to attract birds into your garden is that they are extremely heavy and difficult to move. Once you have it in place, you probably won&rsquo;t move it again. You will need to clean it, so make sure it is in an area that you are able to clean it without having to move it.</p>
	<p>Looking at recyclable materials in your garden, whether this is a plastic bird bath, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/bird-tables/">wooden bird table</a></strong></em></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/black-steel-sunflower-hearts-feeder/">metal bird feeders</a></strong></em></span>, may often be a more attractive offering. This is because they are usually cheaper and as with the stone, you won&rsquo;t have to commit. If you brought a bird bath for example in hope of attracting birds but it didn&rsquo;t then you have paid a lot of money for something that didn&rsquo;t have the desired outcome and it is incredibly hard to move. If you are using more recyclable plastic based products, they will help you figure out where you want things and if they work. Another positive is that they can be recycled, so they won&rsquo;t be thrown away and cause issues with landfill and the ocean.</p>
	<p>The only downside to using these is that they aren&rsquo;t as durable and it is using emissions to recycle the material into something else. Something else to be mindful of is that different areas have different materials that they recycle, so you may end up throwing it away instead.</p>
