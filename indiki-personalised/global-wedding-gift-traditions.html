	<h1>Global Wedding Gift Traditions</h1>
	<p>If there is one thing that unites us as human beings, it is our experiences with love. Love is one of the best and most addictive feelings we can experience, and it is associated with deep feelings of contentment and happiness. Marriage in one form or another is common across most of the world&rsquo;s cultures, though they are celebrated in very different ways which vary region by region and culture by culture. People are a highly diverse bunch, so it makes sense that there are an almost unlimited number of ways to celebrate a wedding.</p>
	<h2>France</h2>
	<p>Seen as one of the most romantic countries in the world, France has many fascinating wedding gift traditions. The main one being that couples usually do not ask for specific gifts as this is seen as presumptuous, and instead most newlyweds are gifted cash. It is popular to have a wedding box present at the reception which guests can place cash and congratulatory cards into. Linen is a traditional gift to give to newlywed couples in France, especially if it French vintage linen. Linen is symbolic of enduring love, as the material gets better with age and when cared for properly it can last a lifetime.</p>
	<h2>Italy</h2>
	<p>In Italy, marriage is considered a holy sacrament by most in this deeply Catholic country. There is plenty of tradition and symbolism involved in Italian weddings, and one of the oldest traditions is to match the extravagance of the wedding gift with the social standing of the wedding couple&rsquo;s families. If they are from high status families then the gifts they will receive will tend to be more expensive and extravagant. Weddings are not just about the couple in this Meditterranean country; they are also about paying respect to the families of the couple. As such, personalised gifts such as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.indiki.co.uk/boxes-for-gifts/wine-boxes">personalised wine box</a></strong></em></span> or jewellery is a good choice for Italian couples.</p>
	<h2>Spain</h2>
	<p>In Spain, like with many European countries, cash is often the gift of choice for newlyweds. It is not uncommon to see couples include their bank information on the wedding invites to make it easy for guests to give them money directly into their bank accounts. As a general rule, guests to a Spanish wedding should give enough cash as a gift to cover their reception meal, though many guests are more generous and will give more than the cost of their meal. It is a lovely Spanish tradition for guests to approach the wedding couple at the head of the table, and present them with a thoughtful gift to say thank you for inviting you to celebrate their special day.</p>
	<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
	<p>In the UK it is seen as a faux pas to arrive at a friend or family member&rsquo;s wedding without a gift for the couple, even if the couple have insisted that they do not want to receive any gifts. Where this is the case, a popular gift idea is to give the couple cash, but should be careful that the gift is not too little or too large. As many people in the UK are getting married later in life, it is unlikely that they will need any homewares which were once traditional wedding gifts for young couples. Instead, many couples will request cash gifts, or will let close friends and family know if there is anything in particular they would like as a wedding gift. Cash is a practical choice for UK couples as they can use it to help fund their honeymoon, recover the costs of the wedding, or can put it towards something that would otherwise be too expensive to buy for themselves.</p>
