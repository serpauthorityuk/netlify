	<h1>Modern Interior Staircase Design Using Stone for a Luxurious Finish</h1>
	<p>No two people will ever have the exact same interior design tastes, even if they tend to like the same interior design styles. This is because there are such an enormous number of ways that a person&rsquo;s sense of style can be applied to a space to make it completely unique, and create a refined sense of personal style. A skilled interior designer will draw inspiration from a range of sources when it comes to redesigning a space, making it unique, adding value to the property, and making it a more attractive prospect for buyers or investors.</p>
	<p>A luxury interior is all about style and practicality, as well as understated elegance. Interior designers know that a space needs to be functional as well as beautiful, otherwise they will have failed in their brief. Striking the perfect balance between form and function takes a keen eye and a lot of design know-how.</p>

	<h2>Stone staircases</h2>
	<p>Stone staircases are a well loved type of interior design which has endured for millennia. Stone staircase examples can be found dating back centuries, and many of the more well preserved examples look almost as good today as when the stones were first cut. Many of these ancient examples are ornately carved and were created for the sole purpose of demonstrating an individual&rsquo;s or a government&rsquo;s wealth. They were designed to impress and therefore often featured dramatic proportions and ornate decoration.</p>
	<p>These days, interior staircase designs tend to take on a more minimalist look. Our tastes have evolved over time and have become more refined. Rather than large and loud shows of wealth and power, many interior designers prefer to make a more subtle, but equally impactful impression though carefully balanced designs which are made to match the flow and feel of a space.</p>
	<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.ianknapper.com/stone-staircases/cantilever-curved-staircase/">floating stone staircase</a></strong></em></span> is a great example of how modern interior designers can create dramatic and bold interior design looks without going overboard. Modern spaces will replicate a fresh and clean look which allows the quality of the stone to speak for itself in many cases. It is an interior designer&rsquo;s trick to keep other decor relatively simple and plain when adding a dramatic stone staircase to a space, as this prevents your eye being drawn away from the focal points of the room.</p>
	<p>Stone can be used to great effect in high traffic areas of buildings such as lobbies, foyers, bathrooms, communal rooms, staircases, and offices as well as hallways and entryways. An experienced designer will assess the overall look of a space and will be able to see its potential and how it might look with impressive features added such as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.ianknapper.com/stone-staircases/spiral-staircases/">stone spiral staircase</a></strong></em></span> or gorgeous stone cladding for the walls.</p>
	<p>Stone can be considered a worthwhile investment in building projects as they are incredibly long lasting and add a lot of value to a property. As well as adding economical gains, stone interior architecture such as staircases give a property more personality and make it unique.</p>
	<p>There are many kinds of stone to choose from when it comes to interior design options, and each will bring a different look to a space. More deeply textured stones make wonderfully tactile additions to interiors and look very attractive when paired with an overall style which makes use of organic colours, textures and shapes. A glossier, more polished stone can give a more refined finish and so they are perfect for creating impressive bathrooms, reception areas for businesses, flooring, and for using as trim for other parts of a building&rsquo;s interior such as built in desks.</p>
