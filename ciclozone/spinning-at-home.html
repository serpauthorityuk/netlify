	<h1>Spinning at Home</h1>
	<h2>Holistic health</h2>
	<p>Making the time to look after your body and mind throughout your life is one of the best things you can do for your long term health and wellbeing. We have long known about the benefits that a healthy lifestyle can offer, but many of us are busier than ever, meaning that our personal health and fitness goals fall by the wayside in favour of hectic work and home life.</p>
	<p>Luckily, there are shortcuts we can take that can make it much easier to adopt a regimen of healthy eating and regular exercise. In doing so, you can start to benefit from improvements to your health such as maintaining an ideal weight, becoming fitter and stronger, having more stamina, and reducing your risks of developing health conditions such as diabetes and heart failure.</p>
	<h2>Exercising for health</h2>
	<p>Elite athletes can burn through as many as 800 calories per hour of physical activity, and it&rsquo;s not unusual for sessions to last for two or three hours at a time. This intense level of exercise is what gives them a competitive edge, allowing them to win medals and break records. You may be pleased to know that you will not need to train to a professional level in order to reap the health benefits of exercise.</p>
	<p>Most people of moderate fitness levels should aim to get around an hour and a half of exercise per week, spread out over three sessions. Gyms are a popular option, with many different kinds of exercise equipment available and something for everyone. You can expect your local gym to contain a variety of equipment for both cardiovascular exercise and strength training. Common options include exercise bikes, treadmills, cross trainers, free weights, and rigs that contain a range of body weight and resistance training options.</p>
	<p>It is also worth considering whether exercising at home might be a sustainable option for you. If you tend to have limited free time to exercise, investing in some home gym equipment makes it much easier to fit sessions in around your other commitments in the home. Your home gym doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything too fancy, you will usually find that <a href="https://www.ciclozone.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>spinning at home</strong></em></span></a>, or running on a treadmill are enough to get your heart pumping without eating into your free time too much.</p>
	<p>If you prefer the atmosphere of a group session, you might want to consider signing up for an exercise class. Led by experienced trainers, there are a huge variety of options available. For a heart-pumping thrill ride, try spinning to get your cardio in. More lightly paced classes include yoga, which relies on strength, controlled movement, and disciplined breathing to provide an experience that exercises your body and calms the mind.</p>

	<h2>Maintaining a healthy diet</h2>
	<p>There is no one answer as to what constitutes a &lsquo;healthy diet&rsquo;, and the answers vary generation to generation and culture to culture. Having said this, there are a few ideas which are fairly universal. It is generally accepted that a healthy diet is one that is rich in fresh produce and features fruits and vegetables prominently alongside healthy fats.</p>
	<p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up about a third of your diet, and try to aim for healthier options such as brown rice and pasta, and wholewheat bread. Wholegrain foods keep you feeling fuller for longer as the body breaks them down slowly, so you are much less likely to experience a sugar spike and slump, and end up reaching for snacks to keep you going.</p>
	<p>Aim to eat at least five portions of fruit and veg per day. Unsweetened dried fruits count as part of your recommended daily intake, as do fruits and vegetables which are frozen or canned, provided they do not contain added sugars. You can also up your daily intake by enjoying a smoothie or fruit juice, just remember that these should be consumed in moderation as they are acidic and can contribute to enamel erosion when consumed too frequently.</p>
	<p>Saturated fat is something that you should avoid eating too often if possible. Foods which are high in saturated fats include fatty and processed meats, cream, pastry, butter, cakes, and fried foods. Look instead for foods which contain unsaturated fats, as these are much healthier and do not contribute to your cholesterol levels in the way that saturated fats do.</p>
