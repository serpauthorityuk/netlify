	<h1>Stylish Oak Furniture for the Home</h1>
	<p>Choosing new furniture for the home can be a drawn out process as there are so many options on the market in different styles and at a mind boggling range of price points. Innovative materials and designs crowd the space and offer plenty of choice for homeowners and renters looking for new pieces, and there is also a thriving market for more traditionally styled furniture in natural, time-honoured materials.</p>
	<p>Most furniture available for the home is made from wood of one kind or another, and there is again a huge amount of choice when it comes to the look and feel of each kind. Oak is perhaps the most enduring and popular wood which is used for furniture, and it has been a much-valued material in construction and furniture manufacturing for centuries.</p>
	<h2>All about oak</h2>
	<p>A deciduous tree, oak grows slowly and trees can be many hundreds of years old when they are felled to produce high quality timber. Slow growing tree species such as oak produce timber with a dense grain which makes it the ideal candidate for creating furniture as it is immensely strong. In the living room an <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/oak-storage-furniture/oak-tv-units.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak TV unit</strong></em></span></a> and other oak pieces can make a dramatic impact, or add a cosy, warm feel to a room depending on the finish.</p>
	<p>Light or dark, oak has a wonderfully decorative grain that takes well to staining, varnishing, oiling and waxing. Oak which has been finished using one of these methods is incredibly resistant to wear and tear, and is less susceptible to rot and insect damage than other softer woods. This, paired with its strength, makes oak a choice that will serve you well for years.</p>

	<h2>Furniture options in oak</h2>
	<p>It is entirely possible to completely furnish your home with oak pieces, as the wood lends itself so perfectly to furniture making that it is ideal for weight bearing and occasional furniture alike. Oak dining tables are a testament to the suitability of oak in the home; they are extremely durable, and most people can expect to get 20 or more years of use from their dining table as long as some basic care requirements are met. Solid and sturdy, they can be found in all sizes to suit all household situations, including extendable and drop leaf tables for smaller spaces and variable requirements.</p>
	<p>Bed frames made from oak can last for many years before they need to be replaced, and can even last a lifetime without much maintenance at all. To fully display the beauty of this wood in the bedroom, choose a bed frame with a tall headboard which has been varnished, oiled or waxed, rather than painted or upholstered. Due to the natural variations in the wood grain, no two oak pieces will ever be exactly alike, and so are a thing of unique beauty to be enjoyed in the home.</p>
	<p>Choosing <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/living-room-oak-furniture/oak-tv-stands.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak TV stands</strong></em></span></a> for communal rooms means that your expensive tech will have a secure and stable base, and many come with inbuilt storage such as drawers. Corner units can be a great option for more awkward spaces and smaller living rooms, and if you have the space you can find bench style units which have a look which is more grand.</p>
	<p>Another living room essential which can be found lovingly crafted in this versatile wood are <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/living-room-oak-furniture/oak-coffee-tables.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak coffee tables</strong></em></span></a>. Not just a place to put your coffee, coffee tables give visitors an insight into the personality of your household so they are often used to display favourite books and magazines, or decorative items such as candles and trinket boxes. By choosing one that suits your home style and looks right for the room it is placed in, you can add a little extra cosiness as well as a convenient place to stash the TV remote.</p>
	<p>To complete the living room, include some kind of storage furniture in oak. Depending on the amount of space you have available, you might want to consider display cabinets or bookcases crafted in oak. If you are a little short on space then an oak storage futon can be just the thing to keep your living room clutter free and well organised.</p>
